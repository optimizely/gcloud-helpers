Helper Functions for the gcloud api

As of 2015/01/14, this only contains a helper
for connecting to the datastore. It can be pip installed
by specifying the git repository (and optionally, a hash).
Also, the gcloud datastore API is being updated pretty rapidly.
This code works with the code at the commit hash
in requirements.txt. If you update this repo to work
with a newer version of gcloud, make sure to update
requirements.txt
